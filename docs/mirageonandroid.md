# Mirage on Android

Trying to get [Mirage](http://openmirage.org) running on Android...

Status: work in progress (2013-09-17) - Ocaml 4.00.1 cross-compiler working; Mirage pre-reqs building with opam; Mirage basic and website_static examples working on Android as native unix/direct applications. Mirari not (yet) used.

I've moved all the details, including general stuff on Ocaml cross-compilation to [ocaml cross-compiling](https://github.com/cgreenhalgh/ocaml-crosscompiling). The specifics on Mirage are also [there](https://github.com/cgreenhalgh/ocaml-crosscompiling/blob/master/docs/mirageonandroid.md).
