<p>Essentially
the OpenSharingToolkit for Android is currently a set of files, including Android apps, media
files and documentation. This has two main aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>creating an OpenSharingToolkit Hub on an Android device;</li>
  <li>other useful client and management applications for Android.</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete file set (or just parts of it)
can be stored on an Android device, or just on a memory card,&nbsp;USB
drive or harddisk. Several of the apps in the OpenSharingToolkit can be
installed on an Android device to make it easier to share files with
other devices, including other android mobile phones and
tablets,&nbsp;laptop and desktop computers and (to a more limited
extent) non-android feature phones.&nbsp;One of the things you can
share with other devices is the Open Sharing Toolkit itself, which can
then be passed on and
on...</p>
<p>We also suggest some types and sources of content that might be useful to share in this way.</p><p>All
of the components of the OpenSharingToolkit are OpenSource (for apps)
or&nbsp;permissively licensed (e.g. Creative Commons) or public domain
(for media) and their redistribution is legal in most countries (e.g.
under the Berne Convention).</p><p>The Android&nbsp;apps in the OpenSharingToolkit (should) initially comprise:</p><ul><li>hub management:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>(for hub use only) a core app that provides essential hub
facilities, including local and remote management, configuration,
logging and audit<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>core apps to support file-sharing:</li>
<ul><li>a file manager, for managing files on the device, including requesting installation of other apps in the OpenSharingToolkit.</li></ul><ul><li>a
small&nbsp;web (HTTP) server, for distributing files to nearby devices
over WiFi, and for other devices to upload new files (usually
additional media files).</li></ul><ul><li>a URL viewer, which shows the URLs that should&nbsp;give access to the web server. It will also display these as QRCodes.</li></ul><ul><li>a QRCode scanner, which allows a device with a camera to start specific file downloads without manually entering a URL.</li><li>a logging application, which can optionally keep a record of files being shared, e.g. for evaluation of the OpenSharingToolkit.</li></ul><li>helper apps to support particular methods of file-sharing </li><ul><li>External
USB mounting app, for devices with USB OTG support (e.g. Nexus 7
tablet) to allow reading/writing of files on external USB storage
(memory cards, USB drives).</li><li>(I don't at the moment whether we can rely on built-in/pre-installed support for Bluetooth, NFC, MMS)&nbsp;</li><li>(There might be other more experimental options at some point, e.g. audio modem)</li></ul><li>media-specific apps:</li><ul><li>(It is assumed that a web browser is pre-installed, i.e. to view web (HTML) pages)</li><li>ePub (eBook) reader</li><li>(It is assumed that an image viewer is pre-installed)</li><li>(It is assumed that a video viewer is pre-installed)</li><li>Com.me multi-media presentation viewer/creator</li><li>OpenStreetMap-compatible map viewer</li></ul><li>Other possible media specific apps that might be included:</li><ul><li>web page (HTML) editor&nbsp;</li><li>audio recorder (MP3?)</li><li>audio transcoder</li><li>image editor (e.g. scale)</li><li>video transcoder</li><li>video editor</li><li>web map server</li></ul><li>Other possible apps related to further app and toolkit development:</li><ul><li>Android IDE</li><li>git client</li><li>language runtime, e.g. python</li><li>busy box tools</li><li>terminal</li><li>SuperSU root supervisor</li></ul></ul>Initial sample media files might include:<br><ul><li>eBooks, e.g.&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Femrite</li><li>Books of the Bible</li><li>Android/programming resources</li></ul><li>Audio, e.g.</li><ul><li>spoken books</li></ul><li>OSM map data</li><li>Video, e.g.</li><ul><li>educational resources&nbsp;</li></ul></ul></body></html>
