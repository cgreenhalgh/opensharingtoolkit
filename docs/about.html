<h1>About Open Sharing Toolkit</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/%7Ecmg/">Chris Greenhalgh</a>, The University of Nottingham, 2013</p>
<p>The
toolkit is intended to allow off-internet sharing of media files and
applications, initially via Android phones and tablets. Most
importantly the toolkit itself can be passed on to others, allowing
off-internet peer distribution.</p>
<p>Initially
this will be an assembly of (often pointers to) third party open source
applications for Android and potentially useful/interesting data and
media files.</p>
<p>This
is a work in progress... (24/06/2013)</p>
