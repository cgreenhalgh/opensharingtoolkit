<h1>About Open Sharing Toolkit</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/%7Ecmg/">Chris Greenhalgh</a>, The University of Nottingham, 2013</p>
<p>The
toolkit is intended to allow sharing of media files and
applications <em>on</em> and <em>off</em>
the Internet. The toolkit aims to support a broad range of media types,
but has an emphasis on the social and institutional embedding of
technologies and media.The toolkit itself can also be reproduced and passed on to others, including
off-internet peer distribution.</p>

<p>The toolkit targets a range of devices and device types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>hubs - (typically) small servers, that can be deployed in strategic locations to provide local access to media and services. <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>a hub will usually support several means of access/interaction, including Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC, USB, SMS, GSM voice<br>
    </li>
    <li>a hub <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> also provide internet connectivity;</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>a hub <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> be
cloud-hosted, but it that case it can only provide services/media to
internet connected devices (or will require the use of a 3rd part
gateway, e.g. for voice, SMS interaction).<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>smart phones and tablets, with an initial emphasis on Android devices, which can become full or limited hubs in their own right<br>
  </li>
  <li>cell phones, which are a critical class of (mass-availability)
client device, including 'dumb' phones, feature phones, smart phones</li>
  <li>other client devices, e.g. laptops, PCs<br>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>Initially
the toolkit will be an assembly of (often pointers to) third party open source
applications (mainly for Linux and Android) and instructions plus potentially useful/interesting data and
media files.</p>
<p>The first explorations (prior to August 2013) targetted Android
devices in particular and a peer-to-peer pattern of operation. The
addition of Hubs introduces more asymetry into the design with the
intention of providing richer services to cell phone clients. It is
anticipated that Linux and Android will be target OSs for the hub.<br>
</p>

<p>This
is a work in progress... (24/06/2013)</p>
