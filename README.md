OpenSource File and App Sharing Toolkit for Android

Chris Greenhalgh, The University of Nottingham, 2013

The toolkit is intended to allow off-internet sharing of media files and applications, initially via Android phones and tablets. Most importantly the toolkit itself can be passed on to others, allowing off-internet peer distribution.

Initially this will be an assembly of (often pointers to) third party open source applications for Android and potentially useful/interesting data and media files. 

This is a work in progress... (24/06/2013)
